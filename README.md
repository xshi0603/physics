## WHAT IS IT?

CoolPhysicsGames is a physics game that attempts to teach users about magnetic fields through the use of a interactive education experience. Users will be able to modify fields, type of particle, velocity of particle, and angle of particle. They will use these key components to navigate a particle through an extensive maze of walls in order to get to the end zone and win the game.

## HOW TO PLAY

1. User must click init-setup to initially set up the game.
2. User will then modify any components they wish to change about the particle.
3. User must then click setup-level after confirming their changes to the particle.
4. User can then use create-fields and change-intensity to modify the magnetic fields by clicking on the patch the user would like to modify.
5. User will then press go to enjoy the game!
6. If User runs into the star, they will gain an extra life! <3
